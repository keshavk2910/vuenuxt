            <p class="widthvariation">Haiti Takes Root was launched during the historic climate summit in
                2015 that led to the Paris Agreement, uniting countries around the world
                to fight climate change. Despite its relatively small contribution to climate
                change, Haiti is one of the most vulnerable to this global phenomenon. Haiti
                is no stranger to being a leader in fighting for justice, and today Haiti is
                part of a global campaign for environmental justice.
