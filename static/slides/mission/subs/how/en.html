            <h4>How We Work</h4>
            <h1>If We Want a Different Result, We Need a Different Approach</h1>
            <p>Haiti Takes Root is a different approach to Haiti’s environmental crisis. In order to break out of the pattern of project cycles and isolated, individual efforts, HTR is focused on uniting actors to embrace approaches grounded in the lessons learned over decades in Haiti and beyond. Instead of creating a new organization, HTR is an initiative to strengthen capacity and coordination amongst existing actors, while putting the Haitian people at the center of all planning, in order to manage Haiti’s natural resources and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
