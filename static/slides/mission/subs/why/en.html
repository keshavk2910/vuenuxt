        <h4>Together for a Greener Haiti</h4>
        <h1>Why Haiti Takes Root?</h1>
        <p>The greatest challenge facing Haiti’s rural population today is the same as it was forty years ago: diminishing harvests and changing weather patterns are leaving Haiti’s farmers more vulnerable year after year. Haiti has been a canary in the coal mine, showing the world what climate change looks like. Haiti Takes Root is a national campaign to support local agricultural production, especially agroforestry – planting trees that are sources of income, including fruit trees and hardwood trees that can help farmers improve their livelihoods and adapt to a changing climate.</p>
