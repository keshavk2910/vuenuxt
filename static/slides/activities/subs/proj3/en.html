        <h1>Canaan Urban Greening</h1>
        <p>
            The growing community in Canaan has begun a process of urbanization in
            an area that is largely arid, treeless and without access to potable
            water. The Canaan Urban Greening program piloted several innovative
            strategies to combine greening for quality of life and environmental
            impact, with physical infrastructure to help the growing city preserve
            critical ecological systems.

            <h1>Canaan Urban Greening</h1>
            <p>
                It was in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake when people
                began building in the vast area known as Canaan, and they created
                their city without any support from the Haitian government or NGOs.
                Rapid urbanization in an environmentally vulnerable area comes with
                many challenges, but communities carved out spaces for playing fields
                and public parks, a delineated a web of roads. <br /><br />
                In partnership with local community leadership known as Neighborhood
                Committees, Acceso social enterprise, and American Red Cross, J/P HRO
                piloted three innovative strategies:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Urban agroforestry: Support to individuals in Canaan to start small
                    tree nurseries and to plant in no-build zones as well as other
                    vulnerable areas. Combining livelihood enhancement with
                    environmental protection
                </li>
                <li>
                    Green and Gray Infrastructure: In one of the largest ravines in
                    Canaan, a combination of traditional ravine correction tactics
                    combined with green infrastructure including trees and grasses have
                    had a visible impact in preventing flooding
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mini-Forests: In this method, a very dense patch of trees, shrubs
                    and grasses/cacti are planted together to mimic a forest. The
                    strategy creates an ecological system where one plant supports
                    another, and where ground cover helps to retain moisture, while an
                    outer ring of tough grasses and cacti prevent goats and other
                    animals from eating the trees
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The strategies in Canaan have been pulled together to form the basis
                of an urban greening toolkit. Read more on our blog
