        <h1>PILOT: Enhanced Agroforestry in Nippes</h1>
        <p>
            In an area where key lime production used to be a major part of the
            economy, HTR is field testing an innovative best practice to form a
            natural barrier to keep the citrus trees safe from pests.

            <p>
                As part of the preparation for the Resilient Productive Landscapes
                (RPL) project, farmers in the four watersheds participated in
                workshops to determine the most important agricultural and
                infrastructure interventions for their region. In community after
                community, farmers explained that for decades, key limes were one of
                the most important products in the NIppes department. The value chain
                included the local market, where people rely on the strong citrus
                juice for preparation of meats and fish, to the export market, where
                Haitian key lime oil is considered a very valuable cooking ingredient.
                <br /><br />
                In May 2018, a pilot program was launched to field test a new strategy
                for protecting the lime trees. In order to create what is called a
                phytorifulsive barrier, guava trees are planted around the lime trees,
                creating a line that pests wonâ€™t cross. So far, 1,120 key lime trees
                have been planted with 120 guava trees to protect them. And because
                the pilot has already begun to prove that this technical approach can
                be successful, more key lime trees will be added until a total of
                5,000 lime trees are healthy and growing in the region.
